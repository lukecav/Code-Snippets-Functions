## LiteSpeed Cach Clearing Cache Tutorial

[LiteSpeed_Cache_API::purge_all()](https://www.litespeedtech.com/support/wiki/doku.php/litespeed_wiki:cache:lscwp:api#litespeed_cache_apipurge_all)'s code and example found on the support site of the plugin.

```
LiteSpeed_Cache_API::purge_post($id)
Purges a single post by id.

LiteSpeed_Cache_API::purge_all()
Purges all existing caches.
```

The PHP snippet below can be used to clear the cache via a third party such as a Cron Job for example. The first section initializes the WordPress environment, normally this PHP file should be located in your WordPress root directory. The second if performs the action of completely clearing the cache and with the third if you have the ability to specify which post ID you would like to clear the cache for.



```
// initilize WordPress environment
if ( !defined('ABSPATH') ) {
	require_once('./wp-load.php');
}

if (class_exists('LiteSpeed_Cache_API')) {
  LiteSpeed_Cache_API::purge_all();
  echo "LiteSpeed Cache cleared successfully!";
} else {
  echo "LiteSpeed Cache Clearing cache failed!";
}

if (class_exists('LiteSpeed_Cache_API')) {
  LiteSpeed_Cache_API::purge_post(111);
  echo "LiteSpeed Cache for post 111 cleared successfully!";
} else {
  echo "LiteSpeed Cache Clearing failed for post 111 !";
}
```
